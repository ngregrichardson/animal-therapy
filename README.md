# :heart_eyes_cat: AnimalTherapy
An infinite source of therapeutic animal pictures that make you go aww.

## About
I developed AnimalTherapy to bypass Reddit's obnoxious un-authenticated user experience on mobile. I regularly browse subreddits looking for animal pictures and videos to send my girlfriend, but since she doesn't use Reddit, she has to go to the link via the web interface. She gets greeted with multiple different kinds of popups asking her to download the app and occasionally has trouble playing the videos, so more often than not she won't bother (or shouldn't have to) going through all of that just to see one video.

So AnimalTherapy was created. Quite simply, AnimalTherapy gets all of the latest top images from [/r/aww](https://reddit.com/r/aww) and puts them in one, easy to use, infinitely scrollable place for her to view. No ads, no popups, just animals.
